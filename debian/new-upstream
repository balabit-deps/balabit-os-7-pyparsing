#
# Finally,  if a third parameter (an action) is given in the watchfile
# line, this is taken as the name of a command, and the command
#  command --upstream-version version filename
# 
# is executed, using either the original file or the symlink name.

# Thanks to Vincent Fourmond's <fourmond@debian.org> freecol package - where he
# thanks Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk> for giving him the idea - for giving me
# the idea.
